# Chucks-Prints
A POC for an automation suite for Chucks 3d printing business using solace pubsub+


This java application is a basic example of subscribing and publishing to a Solace PubSub+ event broker.  
The broker runs on my local server.
The purpose of this application is to experiment with the different ways of communicating with the Solace PubSub+ event broker.
